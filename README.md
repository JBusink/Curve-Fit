# Project Curve_fit versus Lmfit
First github project :=). Let's add some programming later on. Hello world!



# Mock data set + curve_fit:
In this project I will compare two different methods to apply a fit to a dataset. The first method uses scipy.curve_fit() function. Manually I calculate the $\chi^2$. The second method is to use lm-fit package.
